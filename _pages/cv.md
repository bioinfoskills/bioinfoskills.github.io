### Andrea Telatin (Coordinator) 
is a trainer and bioinformatician, working with NGS datasets since its advent in 2007 when he began his PhD at the University of Padua, where he has been teaching assistant and on-contract Professor for 4 years (2008-2012), in courses on genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics and programming. In those years he tutored or co-tutored >10 BSc thesis and 2 MSc thesis, taught 10 courses. After a post-doctoral experience on wine grape genomics, he worked as Head of Bioinformatics for a company (BMR Genomics) delivering a 40-hours bioinformatics course twice a year, with trainees mostly coming from biological research (PhD student to senior researcher and PI level). His experience in an ISO certified company allowed him to investigate best practices for sample identification, reproducible workflows, and protocols validation. 

### Lisa Marchioretto (Project Manager) 
after pursuing her PhD in Epigenomics, decided to focus on project management, becoming the Project Manager of EPIGEN, a 70-partners 30-million euros flagship project of the Italian Ministry of Research. A key component of EPIGEN has been the training of PhD Students and PostDoc in the emerging fields of epigenomics and bioinformatics and the dissemination of results, including the production of professional graphics and an e-book. She is currently project manager of the CLIMB BIG DATA, on a part-time basis, and has the ideal skillset and expertise to manage a training project. 

### George Savva (Biostatistics and research integrity) 
has 15 years’ experience as a biostatistician in health and biological sciences.  Often working as the statistician supporting large interdisciplinary teams, George has contributed to more than 100 academic papers across diverse areas of biomedical science. For four years as Senior Lecturer in applied statistics at the School of Health, University of East Anglia, George refined his pedagogic approach and teaching research methods and statistical thinking at undergraduate and post-graduate level with a PG Cert in Higher Education Practice focussed on the teaching of statistics to non-specialists in health science.  For the past three years George has supported wet-lab scientists and bioinformaticians at Norwich Biosciences Institute, mentoring students and post-doctoral scientists in their approach to statistical design and analysis, developing and providing a programme of training in experimental design, analysis, and research integrity for staff at all levels. 

### Rebecca Ansorge (Metagenomics) 
has a background in Microbiology and Metagenomics. She obtained her PhD in 2019 at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, focussing on high-resolution metagenomics to understand host-microbe associations and evolution. At the International Max Planck Research School of Marine Microbiology (MarMic) she was involved in teaching and training students in symbiosis research and metagenomic analyses. She is a bioinformatician at the Quadram Institute Bioscience, developing analyses pipelines and supporting research projects in metagenomics. Since her start she has delivered and contributed to institute-wide virtual training sessions in bioinformatics and metagenomic analyses. 

### Nabil-Fareed Alikhan (Microbial genomics) 
is a bioinformatician with 11 years experience. His work focuses on microbial genomics, particularly with understanding the genetic basis for why bacteria cause disease. As part of this work, he regularly analyses datasets with thousands of bacterial genomes. He has recently been analysing and managing data for the QIB contribution to the national UK effort for large-scale and rapid whole-genome sequencing of COVID19, as part of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium [https://www.cogconsortium.uk/].  

Nabil-Fareed has also co-developed user-friend tools for data analysis, such as EnteroBase, database for genomic variation within enteric bacteria; Grapetree, a visualisation tool for evolutionary relationships; and BRIG, a visualisation tool for genome comparisons. Together these tools have been cited more than 1,800 times.  

Nabil-Fareed is also interested in promoting best practices in the field. He is a working group member for PH4AGE [https://pha4ge.org/], a global coalition that is actively working to establish consensus standards and share best practices in public health microbial bioinformatics. And he co-hosts the Micro Binfie podcast, which talks about topics affecting bioinformatics such as common pitfalls in data analysis or practical advice on delivering training. The podcast has over 13,000 listens. He has also helped supervise postgraduate students (1 MSc, 2 PhD). 

### Evelien Adriaenssens (Viromics) 
is a group leader at QIB specialised in virus genomics, classification and viral metagenomics (viromics). As part of her supervisory expertise, she has trained multiple postgraduate students (5 MSc, 4 PhD) in virus genomics and viromics. Her training background includes one-on-one training with students, lectures at workshops and the organisation of a command-line viromics workshop run on the CLIMB servers (Aug 2019).  

### Leonardo de Oliveira Martins (Phylogenomics) 
is a computational biologist and the Head of Phylogenomics at QIB. He has developed several statistical models for solving evolutionary questions at the genome-level, using his expertise in high-performance computing environments. Besides traditional output (over 25 articles published, active presence as reviewer for Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology and Evolution, amongst others), he has contributed to open source software (for example for the popular R package “phangorn”) and talks for popularisation of modern phylogenetics —amongst two recent ones, at the Midsummer Phylogenetics course at the University of East Anglia, and at the Micro Binfie Virtual Conference. He co-wrote an educational book on Evolution with other researchers and with middle school students from Portugal and Mexico, published in Portuguese and Spanish, and a chapter for the well-known practical textbook series “Methods in Molecular Biology”. As part of the Swiss Regional Group of the ISCB-SC he organised outreach activities to develop interest in computational biology, like the “Scientific Speed Meeting” or the “Bioinformatics in the Pub” events. His teaching experience include (1) being responsible for the practical for a very well-received Masters module on Bioinformatic Algorithms offered by the University of Lausanne (UNIL) open to any students in Switzerland; (2) as a teaching assistant to second-year bachelor students of Biology at the University of Lausanne in the introductory course of bioinformatics; and (3) as the organiser of the Bioinformatic Lectures of the Department of Ecology and Evolution at UNIL, targeted at the graduate students and postdocs of the department.
