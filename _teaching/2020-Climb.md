# CLIMB Big Data Workshop - 5-6 October 2020

Welcome the first **CLIMB Big Data** workshop!

We realize that you have a broad range of familiarity levels with the command line, so we tried to add **optional** material for those who might be quicker in following our tutorial. Don't feel the urgency of doing every task yourself, and try avoiding copying and pasting commands if you don't understand them: it's not worth and you will not improve by doing so.

Feel always free to ask for help and explanations, we are here to help you and our goal is that every participant should learn something new and become a bit more independent in using the command line.

You will have access to the training server until Friday 9th October, so if you will want to try the tutorial yourselves, you'll have plenty of time to do so.

### ðŸ’¬  Slack channel

For instant messaging, we can use a dedicated Slack room. Unlike the zoom chat, this has nicer text formatting features and won't disappear after our sessions.

## Monday

_Introduction to the command line, the client-server model and the UNIX filesystem._

Introduction to Linux with Mark Pallen

Your first task is to connect to the training server via SSH. Our training server is `climb.seq.space`.
* [Connect via SSH to a remote server](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Connect-via-SSH)

After you successfully logged in, it's time for feeding the first commands to the terminal.
* [First commands](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Short-1)

Bioinformatics requires the ability to store and extract information from simple text files:
* [Text files and the command line](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Short-2)

Some more advanced topics on the command line:
* [Pipes and redirections](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Short-3)

## Tuesday

_Using the command line with bioinformatics files_

* We will start learning [Some new commands](CLIMB-2)
* Followed by a [quick DIY track](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/CLIMB-DIY)

A first bioinformatics exercise:
* [De novo assembly of short reads](https://github.com/telatin/learn_bash/wiki/Assembly)
