Data science, big data and bioinformatics rely on a vast number of tools (packages, electronic notebooks, programming languages and their libraries). This training module aims at up-skilling the trainees on the foundations of high-throughput bioinformatics projects, from design to their implementation.

Key areas that need improved training coverage are:

**Containers** – adopting Docker and Singularity containers for easier sharing of code, and higher reproducibility of the pipelines, finally allowing the perfect re-creation of output from research papers;

**Validation** - Validation of the protocols using synthetic and simulated datasets, to ensure the fit of the adopted strategy for the analyzed dataset,

**Reproducible workflows** – the adoption of workflow managers, like NextFlow, is still not broad, yet they can help to avoid a wide range of errors that beginner would face not using them.
