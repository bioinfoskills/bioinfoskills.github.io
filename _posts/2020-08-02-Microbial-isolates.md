# Microbial genomics to analyse isolates and outbreaks

### Coordinator: Nabil-Fareed Alikhan

This module aims to provide students with an opportunity to work through a complex research project using real world data. This being with initial collection of sequencing data, to performing analyses, to final visualisation. At each step, students will attempt one aspect of the project, with quizzes to assess their proficiency.

This module will allow practical application of lessons learnt in other modules, such as computational skills from (1) for running analyses, statistical skills from (2) for assessing those analyses. Concepts such as de novo genome assembly will overlap with (3).  The study of outbreaks will extend on fundamentals presented in (5).

The datasets studied will include real outbreak data from food borne pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella, and data from the COVID19 pandemic.

Specific components will include common aspects of microbial genomic analysis such as:
*	Retrieving data from public databases 
*	Structuring metadata in accordance with FAIR principles. 
*	Basic quality of genome sequence data. 
*	Common analyses; Comparing multiple genomes or mapping sequence read data to explore a given research question. 
*	Salient assumptions and caveats of analyse tools will presented alongside instructions on how to run them. 
*	Approaches for dealing with datasets of various sizes; scaling up when required.
*	Combining genomic data with empirical data such antimicrobial resistance. 
*	Submitting sequence data to public databases; a required part of scientific publication. 
*	Methods for sharing and distributing dataset and analysis results beyond scientific journals.
